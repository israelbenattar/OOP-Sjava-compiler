In order to run tests put the updatedtestdirectory path as the first argument in the configurations of tests.java. Put the the second
argument is the path to the updatedtestresults file. 

Make sure that your Sjavac.java file looks as such:

public class Sjavac {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ....Your main code that prints 1, 2, or 0 as required....
    }


    public int testRun(String[] args){
        ....Exact Copy of your code from the static main which returns 1, 2, or 0 instead of printing 1, 2, or 0.....


}


In addition, if you peformed a check to see whether or not you had an improper args length in your code somewhere make sure to put
that condition as a comment, otherwise the tests won't work (because the code receives two arguments instead of 1 from the tester).
There are 239 tests in total.
